So, after the update for Xcode 12, all of my apps had the same problems concerning firebase. Something about the Deployment target being too old. However, i did change the target to latest IOS but still the same problem exists. When i changed the Deployment target for firebase pods, more errors came in saying this code is deprecated . Does anyone know anything?
